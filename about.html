                    In order to produce good Architecture, an Architect must always start with the right intentions. At studio Agencies Ltd, we believe
                     that Architecture represents a means to give man an existential foothold. We therefore always see the conception of the work of
                     Architecture as a concretization of life situations. To us an Architectural product is a symbol, that is a work of art, which
                     represents life situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When approaching an Architectural problem we do so appreciating that the purpose of Architecture transcends functionalism, for
                    Architecture has both physical and practical implications. Since one of the basic needs of man is to experience his life situations
                    as meaningful, at studios Agencies Ltd we ensure that the purpose of every work of Architecture we are involved in is to keep and
                    transmit meanings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Studio Agencies Ltd , every Architect subscribes to what the firm has discovered over its substantial years of practice, that
                    there are no different kinds of Architecture, but only different situations which require different solutions in order to satisfy manâ€™s
                    emotional and physical needs. By appreciating this, we are able to ensure our Architectural solutions satisfy the design objectives
                    appropriate to timeless Architecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In any work of Architecture, that we get involved in, we strive to provide our client with a dwelling. In an existential sense, dwelling
                    is the purpose of Architecture. For a man dwells when he can orientate himself within and identify himself with the environment.
                    Under such circumstances he experiences the environment as meaningful. At StudioAgencies Ltd , every Architect is aware that
                    good Architecture aims at visualizing the genius loci, or the spirit of the place and that a good Architect knows that his primary
                    task is to create meaningful places that helps man dwell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At StudioAgencies Ltd, we appreciate a good visual design as an important aspect of Architecture but complete Architecture is
                    only obtainable when an Architect also produces a sound and useful building. Therefore, we do not strive to achieve good
                    aesthetics at the expense of function and stability. At StudioAgencies, we endeavor to satisfy the fundamental principles of
                    Architecture but we distaste coarse and falsely stylistic Architecture. Our design process instead has three major components
                    namely; Conceptual Design, Geometric Design and Operational Design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Conceptual arrangement is largely a statement of intent for the guidance of Structural and Service Engineering Consultants
                    and for use in obtaining information from many manufacturers and suppliers who will be involved in the work. The Geometric
                    Design deals with the detailed visual inter-relationships between all parts of the building as the Operational stage develops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Operational design deals with solving of problems associated with individual components and their assembly and integration
                    in the total design. The Operational stage is in essence the work done by the Architect and Specialists in the investigation of their
                    own area of work, but within the framework of the basic concept. By approaching a design problem this way, it is easier for the
                    design team to reach major agreements in an easier and quicker manner. This avoids major changes being introduced after a
                    particular design stage, a situation which if allowed to occur, tends to frustrate the work of others. The smooth working of the
                    team tends to be destroyed if one member upsets the others.
