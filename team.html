                    This is always the first stage of our building process. In this stage problem areas are postulated. This helps us to delineate the
                    boundaries of all subsequent investigation. The boundaries are not sacrosanct as subsequent work may well uncover facts which
                    will disturb the original genesis of the project.

                <p>
                    This includes the gathering of all relevant information. During this stage we also review existing examples or phenomena. The
                    selections of what to observe, and how to record the observations is done with skill and objectivity.

                <p>
                    In this stage the results of observations, in terms of data collection, fact nding, and areas of success, failure or redundancy are
                    assessed, sometimes by statistical processes. This allows the problem to be reduced to manageable proportions.

                <p>
                    After reviewing the collated information we frame hypotheses. This involves the development of a theory leading to a useful
                    classification of consistent aims. Testing of hypotheses, by means of optical or mathematical models is usually
                    undertaken. These may well suggest further questions at this stage, and require backtracking to the first stage

                <p>
                    This establishes the relevance of the hypothesis as nally expressed and begin to point a solution, or in many cases, possible
                    alternative solutions which in their time should be evaluated, and their constraints and values recognized.

                    - During this stage one essential solution is adopted so that a course of action can be con dently pursued. This is clearly
                      documented and the priorities in the decision to proceed clearly stated.
                    - The sequence of our methodology, which has all the above stages, is by no means linear but is spiral like. Constant reappraisal
                      is a necessary part of the design and the building process. We therefore pursue solutions for our Architectural problems in a
                      spiral manner. Ours is a to and fro process which ensures progress along the way in the same way we ascend a spiral
                      staircase. This way we are able to adequately order and assess the information gathered.
                    - On a continually basis we criticize our tentative solution, we occasionally change our intentions but nally make sure that we
                      have successfully met our expectations and those of our clients. By carefully assessing and analyzing our clients â€™ needs and
                      requirements we are able to attain better understanding of the problem and can therefore formulate expectations for ourselves
                      and our clients which are appropriate and adequate.

                    Studio Agencies Ltd appreciate that no developer has limitless resources and thereforethere is need for projects to be
                    executed within reasonable budgets. The firm has therefore evolved systems and mechanisms that enable it to undertake
                    building projects at very low cost. The firm cut the cost of projects by addressing the following key areas of the building
                    process.
